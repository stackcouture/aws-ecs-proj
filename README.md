### Architecture

#### 1️⃣ EC2 Setup
- Ubuntu EC2 instance
- Install Jenkins, Docker, Trivy, Terraform

#### 2️⃣ CI/CD Pipeline
- Jenkins pipeline pulls source code from GitHub
- Authenticates with AWS and builds Docker image
- Pushes Docker image to **AWS ECR**
- Runs **Trivy & Snyk scans** for container security

#### 3️⃣ Infrastructure Provisioning (Terraform)
- VPC with public subnets
- Internet Gateway & Route Tables
- ALB & Target Groups
- ECS Cluster and Task Definitions

#### 4️⃣ Deployment
- Jenkins deploys the latest Docker image to ECS
- Automatic deployment across dev/test/prod environments via shared library functions

### Jenkins Pipeline Highlights

- `@Library('my-shared-lib') _` for reusable CI/CD functions
- Environment variables: `IMAGE_NAME`, `IMAGE_TAG`, `TF_DIR`, `AWS_CREDENTIALS_ID`
- Stages:
  1. Clean Workspace
  2. Git Checkout
  3. AWS Authentication
  4. Build Docker Image
  5. Trivy Scan
  6. Push Docker Image to ECR
  7. Snyk Container Scan
  8. Provision ECS (Terraform)
  9. Deploy to ECS
