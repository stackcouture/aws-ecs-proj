## ⚙️ Architecture

### 1️⃣ EC2 Setup
- Ubuntu EC2 instance
- Install Jenkins, Docker, Trivy, Terraform

### 2️⃣ CI/CD Pipeline
- Jenkins pipeline pulls source code from GitHub
- Authenticates with AWS and builds Docker image
- Pushes Docker image to **AWS ECR**
- Runs **Trivy & Snyk scans** for container security

### 3️⃣ Infrastructure Provisioning (Terraform)
- VPC with public subnets
- Internet Gateway & Route Tables
- ALB & Target Groups
- ECS Cluster and Task Definitions

### 4️⃣ Deployment
- Jenkins deploys the latest Docker image to ECS
- Automatic deployment across dev/test/prod environments via shared library functions
